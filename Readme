# The following package were used: 

data.table
dplyr

After download the data set, and directory was created. 
The following steps were performed: 
Step 0 Steps were performed to understand the nature and characteristics of the data. 
# Step 1 - Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set. I joined two data frames (datasets) vertically by using the "rbind" and "cbind" functions. I can do this as the two data frames have the same variables.
# Step 2 - Extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
# Step 3 - Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
# Step 4 Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
# 5.From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
